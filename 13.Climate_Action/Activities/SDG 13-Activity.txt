Group Activity/ TSURU’ Challenge: SDG #13 Climate Action

In this SDG, we will focus on indicator 13.3.1, which refers to improving education, awareness, and human and institutional capacity regarding climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

GROUP ACTIVITY

Create a solution with your team that contributes to solving one of the following topics: loss of biodiversity, rising sea levels in coastal areas, or smog pollution. Then, discuss the issue with your team and develop the proposal using a poster, model, or another alternative to present the solution. You have 4 lessons to complete it.

TSURU’ CHALLENGE

Ecoblock Creation

For this activity, we will use: clean plastic bottles without labels and with caps.

Procedure:

Place candy wrappers, cookie bags, chip bags, etc. (everything must be clean and dry) into the bottle, then compact it using a stick.

How does this activity contribute?

Some construction materials can be replaced, reducing the carbon footprint.
For every finished ecoblock, you will receive ecoins, which can be exchanged for products.
You will contribute to a circular economy, a model that involves sharing, renting, reusing, repairing, renewing, and recycling existing materials and products as many times as possible to create added value. This way, the lifecycle of products is extended.
