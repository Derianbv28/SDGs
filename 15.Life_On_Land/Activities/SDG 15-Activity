Group Activity / TSURU’ Challenge: SDG #15 Life on Land Ecosystems

In this SDG, we will focus on indicator 15.2.1, which refers to promoting the sustainable management of all types of forests, halting deforestation, restoring degraded forests, and significantly increasing global afforestation and reforestation.

GROUP ACTIVITY

With your teacher, plant legume or flower seeds in pots and note the changes you observe week by week. When they reach the middle stage, transplant them to a suitable location and record what changes occurred during the final stage.

TSURU’ CHALLENGE

In this activity, we will make plantable paper.

Materials:
Recycled paper, water, blender, frame or sieve, sponge, and seeds.

First, tear the paper into pieces, then place the pieces in a container with water. Pour the pulp onto the sieve and remove excess water with the sponge. Finally, turn the paper over, add seeds of your choice, and let it dry on a cloth.

This way, you will not only create recycled paper, but you will also contribute to the production of various plants.

How can we plant the paper?

Soak the paper for a few minutes.
Once it softens, it's ready to be placed in a pot.
Plant the paper about 5mm into the soil, leaving part of the surface uncovered.
That's it! Remember to take care of it and monitor it every day.
